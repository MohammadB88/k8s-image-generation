# k8s-image-generation
End-to-end guide to deploying, scaling, and testing image generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, ControlNet) on Kubernetes using modern inference engines and serving frameworks like KServe and vLLM.

This repo provides:

- Deployment manifests and Helm charts
- Inference engine setup (e.g., TGI, Triton, vLLM)
- API access and testing workflows
- Monitoring and autoscaling guidance



Ideal for MLOps practitioners building scalable, GPU-accelerated image generation services on Kubernetes.
